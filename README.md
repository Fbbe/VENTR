## 🐍・ Download Python

Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to start off if you don't have it already!
```sh-session
python v3.10.1 or higher
```

### 1. Open the install.bat:
```
This file will download all the required modules for you. You can then open the .py file with either cmd or python launcher. 
```

### 2. Input Amount Of Codes
```
This is self explanatory, just type an amount you'd like to check.
I'd recommend 5000+.
```
### 3. Input Webhook
```
You will now be prompted to input your webhook. This is so valid codes
can be sent to the webhook so you can instantly claim them. Once you've 
done this press enter.
```
### 4. Code Checking
```
100s of codes will be created and checked. Most will be invalid but there is 
a small chance a code will be generated. Now you can just wait and hope to get
lucky!
```
### 5. Your Welcome, Enjoy!
